# Managing the Built-in Admin Account in Argo CD

Managing the built-in admin account in Argo CD is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of your Argo CD instance. Here's how you can manage this account, including changing its password and disabling it if necessary.

## Changing the Admin Password

1. **Log into Argo CD CLI:**
   First, ensure you're logged into your Argo CD instance via the CLI. Use the current admin password for this.
   ```bash
   argocd login <ARGOCD_SERVER>
   ```
   Replace `<ARGOCD_SERVER>` with your Argo CD server's address.

2. **Change the Admin Password:**
   To change the admin password, use the `argocd account update-password` command.
   ```bash
   argocd account update-password
   ```
   - You will be prompted to enter the current password, followed by the new password.

## Disabling the Admin Account

If you want to disable the built-in admin account for security reasons, you can do so by editing the Argo CD configuration.

1. **Edit the Argo CD ConfigMap:**
   The admin account settings are stored in the `argocd-cm` ConfigMap.
   ```bash
   kubectl edit configmap argocd-cm -n argocd
   ```
   - Ensure you have the necessary permissions to edit ConfigMaps in the `argocd` namespace.

2. **Disable the Account:**
   In the ConfigMap, set the `accounts.admin.enabled` field to `false`.
   ```yaml
   data:
     accounts.admin.enabled: "false"
   ```

3. **Apply the Changes:**
   Save and exit the editor to apply the changes. Argo CD will automatically pick up these changes.

## Important Notes

- **Backup Access:** Before disabling the admin account, ensure you have another user account with administrative privileges to avoid being locked out.
- **Security Best Practices:** Regularly update the admin password and consider disabling the account if it's not in use, especially in production environments.
- **Auditing:** Keep track of who has access to the admin account and monitor its usage.
- **Alternative Authentication Methods:** If you are using an external identity provider (like SSO), you might not need the built-in admin account.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage the built-in admin account in Argo CD, ensuring that your deployment environment remains secure and well-maintained.
