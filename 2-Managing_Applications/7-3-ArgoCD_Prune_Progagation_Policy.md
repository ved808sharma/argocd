# Argo CD Synchronization: Prune and Propagation Policy

In Argo CD, a powerful tool for continuous deployment to Kubernetes, the concept of synchronization is fundamental. This process ensures that the desired state defined in your Git repository is accurately reflected in your Kubernetes clusters. Among the various settings available during synchronization, the `prune` and `propagationPolicy` parameters are particularly crucial.

## Prune
This parameter is used to remove resources that are no longer defined in the Git repository but still exist in the Kubernetes cluster. It's essential for maintaining a clean and efficient environment, aligning the actual state with the desired state in the repository.

## Propagation Policy
This dictates how the pruning process should be executed. There are typically three options:

- **Foreground**: With this setting, the deletion process occurs in the foreground. This means that the command waits for the deletion to be acknowledged by the Kubernetes API server before proceeding. It's more synchronous in nature, ensuring that resources are deleted before moving on.

- **Background**: In contrast, a background propagation policy initiates the deletion and then immediately moves on without waiting for confirmation from the Kubernetes API server. This is more asynchronous, allowing other processes to continue while the deletion occurs in the background.

- **Orphan**: This unique policy allows for resources to be 'orphaned' rather than deleted. When a resource is orphaned, it remains in the cluster but is no longer managed by Argo CD. This is useful for scenarios where certain resources need to persist beyond the lifecycle of their parent resources or the Argo CD application itself.

In practice, choosing the right propagation policy depends on your specific needs and the nature of your Kubernetes environment. Foreground pruning ensures a more controlled and predictable deletion process, while background pruning is useful for non-blocking operations. Orphaning resources can be beneficial in situations where you need resources to outlive the Argo CD application that created them.

It's essential to understand the implications of each option and choose accordingly to maintain a robust and efficient CI/CD pipeline with Argo CD.
